This is a starter program for using Python, SQLAlchemy and Alembic.

I have been using Flask a lot lately with Flask-SQLAlchemy and Flask-Migrate.

They work great but they do things a little bit differently then "plain" SQLAlchemy and Alembic.

I wanted to create a base project and this is it.

This needs to be cleaned up but it's a good start.
